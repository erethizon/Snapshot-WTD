## Working on a first pass of exploratory data analysis on the question "Do deer ruin everything"

Collaboration with Bill McShea, Stephen Webb, Marcus Lashua et others from Snapshot team (Mike, Roland).

Based on zoom chat 4 Sept 2020 with McShea, Webb.  ELB to do WTD, Bill will do Mulies.

Summary stats on relationship b/w deer abundance and urbanization, land use category, mammal species richness, physiographic location.  Constrain sample sites to those within natural range of WTD.  

## Set up workspace
Add packages and load data

```{r}
rm(list = ls()) #clear workspace
library(tidyverse)

#read in first data set
GPP_Cult<-read.csv("Data/SS_USADeployments_annotated.csv", stringsAsFactors = T)
TempPrecip<-read.csv("Data/SNAPSHOT_USA_2019_observations__temp_precip.csv")
Sub<-read.csv("Data/per_subproject.csv")
Det<-read.csv("Data/deployments_detection_count.csv")
